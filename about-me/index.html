            <p>I LOVE making music, listening to music, drawing, playing video games, and learning new stuff.  
                <br><br>

                I used to do song covers when I was around 10, recording myself singing over instrumentals on my dad’s old setup. During the pandemic, I met Aszu and Skidee on a Discord server full of people I became friends with. We used to mess around all day—Skidee was making beats, Aszu did YouTube.  
                <br><br>
                I recorded my first song <a href="https://push.fm/fl/mattemaxima" target="_blank">Matte Maxima</a> on my dad’s old iPhone, and Skidee placed the every vocals manually over his beat. People loved it. He probably saw me going far ahead and has been helping me move forward ever since—he’s gonna be here forever, no doubt.

            <p>Music was never <b>the</b> thing I thought I’d do when I grew up, but it’s always been a huge part of me, even without realizing it. My Dad is a DJ, so I guess it runs in the blood.  
<br><br>
                I always listened to rap even when I did not understand a word—i just tried to imitate the accent, and was surprisingly good at it. The first video my dad recorded of me singing was because he caught me randomly singing and was surprised at how good the accent was lol.
                <br><br>
                I grew up on Drake, Bruno Mars, Em—all the mainstream artists, yfm? But props to Skidee for introducing me to the underground. I make the typa music I want to listen to, and wanna share it with people all over the world.

            <p>Besides making music, I love creating websites (like the one you're on right now). I also draw I'm gonna be learning to animate soon too. I also wanna make short films, and if I get good at it, maybe even direct a movie someday.  
<br><br>
                One of my biggest dreams is making a soundtrack for a movie. Phil Collins is one of the artists I look up to—he used to go crazy on the drums, and his songs still slap. I wish for a legacy like that for myself.

                Aszu and Skidee might just be Godsent Angels to probably look out for me cause i dont think anybody would go to certain extents for some guy they met off discord. 
                
                <br><br>
                Aszu is the friend that came out of nowhere and held it down since day one, he's been a big part of my life.
                <br>and Skidee is like the big bro I never had. he constantly pushes me forward helping me create more stuff and introduces me to new things very often
                <br><br>
                I've seen them grow and grew with them, and I'm beyond blessed to call them my people.
                 <br>
                <br>
                 theres a lot of people i wanted include in here but It'd be a lil too big so eh

        <p>If you actually read through this, I appreciate you. I appreciate the people who listen to my music and rock with it—that love keeps me going, and I’ll always be grateful. I have an ocean of ideas and i cant wait to present them in front of yall.

                            Shoutout to my Mum and Dad for giving me the life I have—they mean the world to me.  
                           
                            I have dreams that probably nobody around me would ever think of, but I plan to achieve them and make the people who put their faith in me proud.
