            <p>I LOVE making music, listening to music, drawing, playing video games, and learning new stuff.  
                <br><br>

                I used to do song covers when I was around 10, recording myself singing over instrumentals on my dad’s old setup. During the pandemic, I met Aszu and Skidee on a Discord server full of people I became friends with. We used to mess around all day—Skidee was making beats, Aszu did YouTube.  
                <br><br>
                I recorded my first song <a href="https://push.fm/fl/mattemaxima">Matte Maxima</a> on my dad’s old iPhone, and Skidee placed the every vocals manually over his beat. People loved it. He probably saw me going far ahead and has been helping me move forward ever since—he’s gonna be here forever, no doubt.

            <p>Music was never <b>the</b> thing I thought I’d do when I grew up, but it’s always been a huge part of me, even without realizing it. My Dad is a DJ, so I guess it runs in the blood.  
<br><br>
                I always listened to rap even when I did not understand a word—i just tried imitate the accent, and was surprisingly good at it. The first video my dad recorded of me singing was because he caught me randomly singing and was surprised at how good my accent was. He wanted to post it on Facebook, lol.  
                <br><br>
                I grew up on Drake, Bruno Mars, Em—all the mainstream artists, yfm? But props to Skidee for introducing me to the underground. I make the typa music I want to listen to, and wanna share it with people all over the world.

            <p>Besides making music, I love creating websites (like the one you're on right now). I also draw I'm gonna be learning to animate soon too. I also wanna make short films, and if I get good at it, maybe even direct a movie someday.  
<br><br>
                One of my biggest dreams is making a soundtrack for a movie. Phil Collins is one of the artists I look up to—he used to go crazy on the drums, and his songs still slap. I wish for a legacy like that for myself.

                Shoutout to my Mum and Dad for giving me the life I have—they mean the world to me.  
                 <br><br>
                I have dreams that probably nobody around me would ever think of, but I plan to achieve them and make the people who put their faith in me proud.
